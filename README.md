# GNNs optimization of the AP and Pilot allocation in Cell-Free MIMO Systems

## Versions:
    # 20241108: 
        # Added:
            # Include the method main_CDF.py that compute the CDF that generates the values
              to generate the CDF graphs for Optimal, DCC and ALL baselines.   
    # 20241109: 
        # Added:
            # Include the Graph_SEs_CDF.py script to generate the graphs for CDF and histogram of 
              number of serving APs. It loads only the values for the Optimal, DCC and ALL baselines. 
    
    # 20241111:
        # Added:
            # Review the main_SampleGenerating.py script to generate the samples for training the GNNs.
            # Include the script functionsGraphHandling.py to handle the buffer of training data, and
                the functions to convert the communication matrices into the graph-structured data.

    # To do:
        # Work on the script for generating samples for training the GNNs (Done).
